# Machine-Learning-algorithms
The Machine Learning algorithms are taken from the book Python Data Science Handbook written by Jake VanderPlas (a really AWESOME work).
I have selected some important parts of this book about machine learning algorithms.
Several changes are made to make sure the codes could run (as some libraries are constantly being updated).
The establishment of this repository is only for academic purposes.

提醒：为了代码的正常运行，有些数据的载入需要在外网中进行。
